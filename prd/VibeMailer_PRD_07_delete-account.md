# Delete Account Feature PRD

## Introduction/Overview
The Delete Account feature allows users to permanently remove their account and all associated data from the VibeMailer platform. This feature is essential for user privacy and data control, providing users with the ability to completely remove their presence from the platform when they no longer wish to use the service.

## Goals
1. Provide users with a clear and straightforward way to delete their account
2. Ensure complete removal of all user data and associated content
3. Maintain user trust through transparent communication about the deletion process
4. Allow users to create new accounts with previously used email addresses after deletion

## User Stories
1. As a user, I want to delete my account so that I can remove my data from the platform
2. As a user, I want to understand the consequences of account deletion before proceeding
3. As a user, I want to receive confirmation of my account deletion via email
4. As a user, I want to be able to create a new account with my previous email address after deletion

## Functional Requirements
1. The system must provide a "Delete Account" option in the user's account settings
2. The system must display a warning message explaining the consequences of account deletion
3. The system must require explicit confirmation before proceeding with account deletion
4. The system must permanently delete all user data including:
   - User profile information
   - All associated projects
   - All scheduled content deliveries
   - All generated content
5. The system must send a confirmation email to the user's email address after successful deletion
6. The system must allow the user's email address to be used for new account registration after deletion

## Non-Goals (Out of Scope)
1. Data export/download before deletion
2. Password verification before deletion
3. Cooling-off period or account recovery after deletion
4. Soft delete functionality
5. Notifications to other users or systems
6. Restrictions on account deletion based on account age or status

## Design Considerations
1. The delete account option should be clearly visible but not prominent in the account settings
2. The warning message should be displayed in a modal dialog with clear visual hierarchy
3. The confirmation dialog should require explicit action (e.g., typing "DELETE" or clicking a prominent button)
4. The delete account button should be styled in a way that indicates its destructive nature (e.g., red color)

## Technical Considerations
1. Implement proper database cascading deletes to ensure all related data is removed
2. Ensure proper cleanup of any scheduled jobs or tasks
3. Implement proper email sending for deletion confirmation
4. Ensure proper session termination after account deletion

## Success Metrics
1. Successful completion of account deletion process
2. Confirmation email delivery rate
3. Number of support tickets related to account deletion
4. Number of users who attempt to delete their account but cancel at the warning stage

## Confirmation Email Copy
Subject: Your VibeMailer Account Has Been Deleted

```
Dear [User's First Name],

We're sorry to see you go. This email confirms that your VibeMailer account has been successfully deleted.

All your personal information, projects, and content have been permanently removed from our systems.

If you change your mind, you can always create a new account using this email address.

Thank you for using VibeMailer.

## Open Questions
1. Should we implement any analytics tracking for account deletions to understand user churn?
2. Should we add a brief exit survey to understand why users are leaving?
3. Should we implement any rate limiting on account deletion to prevent abuse?
