# Password Reset Feature PRD

## Introduction/Overview
The Password Reset feature allows users who have forgotten their password to regain access to their VibeMailer account. This feature provides a secure and user-friendly way to reset passwords while implementing necessary security measures to prevent abuse.

## Goals
1. Enable users to reset their password when forgotten
2. Maintain account security through proper validation and rate limiting
3. Provide clear feedback throughout the password reset process
4. Ensure successful password reset through email notifications

## User Stories
1. As a user who forgot their password, I want to request a password reset so that I can regain access to my account
2. As a user who requested a password reset, I want to receive a new password via email so that I can log in to my account
3. As a user who received a new password, I want to be notified when my password is successfully changed so that I know the process is complete
4. As a user, I want to see clear error messages if my password reset request fails so that I understand what went wrong

## Functional Requirements
1. The system must provide a "Forgot Password" link on the login page
2. The system must display a form to enter email address for password reset
3. The system must validate that the entered email exists in the database
4. The system must implement rate limiting:
   - Maximum 3 reset attempts per hour per IP address
   - Maximum 5 reset attempts per day per email address
5. The system must generate a new password that meets the following criteria:
   - Minimum 8 characters
   - Must contain both letters and numbers
6. The system must send an email containing the new password with:
   - Subject: "Your VibeMailer Password Has Been Reset"
   - Content: Clear instructions and the new password
7. The system must send a confirmation email when the password is successfully changed
8. The system must require users to log in with their new credentials after reset
9. The system must display appropriate error messages for:
   - Non-existent email addresses
   - Rate limit exceeded
   - System errors

## Non-Goals (Out of Scope)
1. Password reset token system
2. User ability to choose their own new password
3. Mobile app integration
4. Password reset via SMS or other methods
5. Password strength meter or validation
6. Password history tracking
7. Integration with third-party authentication services

## Design Considerations
1. The "Forgot Password" link should be clearly visible but not prominent on the login page
2. The password reset form should be simple and focused:
   - Single input field for email
   - Clear submit button
   - Link to return to login
3. Error messages should be:
   - Displayed in red
   - Clear and specific
   - Positioned near the relevant input field
4. Success messages should be:
   - Displayed in green
   - Clear and actionable
   - Include next steps

## Technical Considerations
1. Implement rate limiting using IP address and email address tracking
2. Store rate limit attempts in a temporary cache with appropriate expiration
3. Use secure random number generation for password creation
4. Implement email sending with proper error handling
5. Log all password reset attempts for security monitoring
6. Ensure all emails are sent asynchronously to prevent blocking the main thread

## Success Metrics
1. Password reset success rate > 95%
2. Average time to complete password reset < 5 minutes
3. Support tickets related to password reset < 1% of total tickets
4. Rate limit triggers < 0.1% of total reset attempts

## Open Questions
1. Should we implement any additional security measures beyond rate limiting?
2. What should be the exact format of the generated passwords?
3. Should we implement any specific email templates or just use plain text?
4. How long should we retain logs of password reset attempts?
