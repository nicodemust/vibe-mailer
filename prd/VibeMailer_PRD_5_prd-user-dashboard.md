# User Dashboard PRD

## Introduction/Overview
The User Dashboard serves as the central landing page after successful user login, providing a comprehensive view of the user's content generation projects and access to account management functions. It aims to give users a clear overview of their projects and quick access to key actions.

## Goals
1. Provide users with immediate visibility of all their content generation projects
2. Enable quick access to project management actions (create, edit, delete)
3. Offer easy navigation to account management functions
4. Present project information in a clear, organized manner
5. Support efficient project management through filtering and sorting capabilities

## User Stories
1. As a logged-in user, I want to see all my projects in a table format so that I can quickly understand my content generation setup
2. As a user, I want to create new projects directly from the dashboard so that I can easily set up new content generation
3. As a user, I want to edit or delete existing projects from the dashboard so that I can manage my content generation setup
4. As a user, I want to access my account settings from the dashboard so that I can manage my personal information
5. As a new user with no projects, I want to see a clear call-to-action to create my first project

## Functional Requirements
1. The system must display a table of user projects with the following columns:
   - Project name
   - Frequency
   - Prompt preview (first 50 characters)
   - Creation date
   - Last delivery date
   - Next scheduled delivery

2. The system must provide the following action buttons for each project:
   - Edit project
   - Delete project

3. The system must include a "Create New Project" button prominently displayed

4. The system must provide links to account management pages:
   - Edit account details
   - Change password
   - Delete account

5. The system must support filtering and sorting on all table columns

6. The system must display an empty state with a "Create New Project" button when the user has no projects

## Non-Goals (Out of Scope)
1. Project analytics or detailed metrics
2. Real-time updates or notifications
3. Project status indicators
4. Batch operations on projects
5. Project search functionality
6. Project categorization or tagging
7. Export functionality for project data

## Design Considerations
1. Table Layout:
   - Clean, modern table design
   - Responsive layout that works on desktop and tablet
   - Clear column headers
   - Truncated prompt text with ellipsis
   - Consistent date formatting

2. Action Buttons:
   - Prominent "Create New Project" button
   - Clear, accessible edit and delete buttons for each project
   - Consistent button styling with the rest of the application

3. Empty State:
   - Clear messaging for users with no projects
   - Prominent "Create New Project" call-to-action

## Technical Considerations
1. Integration with existing authentication system
2. Efficient data loading and pagination for large project lists
3. Proper date handling and formatting
4. Secure handling of project deletion
5. Responsive table implementation

## Success Metrics
To be defined in future iterations

## Open Questions
1. Should there be a confirmation dialog for project deletion? Yes
2. What should be the default sort order of the projects table? Creation date, latest on top
3. Should there be a limit on the number of projects displayed per page? not at this point, we can introduce pagination later
4. How should the system handle very long project names in the table? display only the first 20 char + "..."
