# User Registration - Product Requirements Document

## Introduction/Overview
The User Registration feature serves as the entry point for new users to create their VibeMailer accounts. This feature enables users to establish their presence on the platform, allowing them to start receiving AI-generated content based on their preferences. The registration process is designed to be straightforward while collecting essential information for personalization and account management.

## Goals
1. Enable new users to create accounts quickly and securely
2. Collect necessary user information for personalization
3. Ensure data validation and security during registration
4. Provide clear feedback during the registration process
5. Seamlessly transition users to their dashboard after successful registration

## User Stories
1. As a new user, I want to create an account so that I can start receiving AI-generated content
2. As a new user, I want to provide my basic information so that my content can be personalized
3. As a new user, I want to receive immediate feedback if my registration fails
4. As a new user, I want to be redirected to my dashboard after successful registration

## Functional Requirements
1. The system must provide a registration form with the following fields:
   - First name (required)
   - Last name (required)
   - Email address (required)
   - Password (required)
2. The system must validate all input fields:
   - Names must contain only letters and spaces
   - Email must be in valid format
   - Password must meet minimum security requirements (8+ characters, mix of letters/numbers)
3. The system must check for existing email addresses to prevent duplicate accounts
4. The system must create a new user record in the database upon successful registration
5. The system must send a welcome email to the user's registered email address
6. The system must redirect users to the login page or dashboard after successful registration
7. The system must display appropriate error messages for:
   - Invalid input formats
   - Existing email addresses
   - Server errors
   - Network connectivity issues

## Non-Goals (Out of Scope)
1. Social media authentication integration
2. Email verification process
3. Password strength meter
4. Remember me functionality
5. Two-factor authentication
6. Custom username creation

## Design Considerations
1. The registration form should be clean and minimal
2. Form fields should have clear labels and placeholder text
3. Error messages should be displayed inline with the relevant fields
4. The submit button should be prominent and clearly labeled
5. Loading states should be shown during form submission
6. The form should be responsive and work well on all device sizes

## Technical Considerations
1. Implement CSRF protection for the registration form
2. Use secure password hashing (bcrypt or similar)
3. Implement rate limiting to prevent brute force attempts
4. Ensure all data is properly sanitized before storage
5. Use HTTPS for all form submissions
6. Implement proper session management after registration

## Success Metrics
1. Registration completion rate (target: >80%)
2. Time to complete registration (target: <2 minutes)
3. Number of failed registration attempts
4. Number of support tickets related to registration issues
5. User retention rate after first registration
