# User Login Feature PRD

## Overview
The User Login feature enables returning users to securely access their VibeMailer dashboard by authenticating their credentials. This feature is essential for maintaining user security while providing seamless access to personalized content delivery services.

## Goals

## User Experience
### User Flow
1. User navigates to login page
2. User enters email and password
3. System validates credentials
4. If valid:

   - Display error message
   - Allow retry
