# VibeMailer - Edit Project Feature PRD

## Introduction/Overview
The Edit Project feature allows users to modify their existing content generation projects. This feature is essential for maintaining flexibility in content delivery schedules and ensuring the generated content remains relevant to users' evolving needs.

## Goals
1. Enable users to modify their project prompts and delivery frequency
2. Maintain data consistency when updating project settings
3. Provide a seamless user experience for project modifications
4. Ensure immediate effect of changes on future content generation

## User Stories
1. As a content creator, I want to update my project's prompt so that I can refine the type of content being generated
2. As a busy professional, I want to adjust my content delivery frequency so that I can better manage my content consumption
3. As a user, I want to see my current project settings when editing so that I can make informed changes
4. As a user, I want to receive immediate confirmation of my changes so that I know my updates were successful

## Functional Requirements
1. The system must display the current project settings (prompt and frequency) when editing
2. The system must allow users to modify the project prompt
3. The system must allow users to change the content delivery frequency
4. The system must validate all input fields before saving changes
5. The system must update the project settings in the database
6. The system must reschedule content generation based on new frequency settings
7. The system must provide clear success/error feedback after save attempts
8. The system must maintain the project's creation date and other metadata
9. The system must preserve the project's history while updating future content generation

## Non-Goals (Out of Scope)
1. Changing the project's creation date
2. Modifying the project's history or past content
3. Changing the project's owner
4. Bulk editing multiple projects simultaneously
5. Modifying project metadata beyond prompt and frequency

## Design Considerations
1. The edit interface should match the create project form for consistency
2. Pre-fill all fields with current project values
3. Use the same validation rules as project creation
4. Provide clear visual feedback for successful/failed updates
5. Include a cancel button to discard changes
6. Show a confirmation dialog for significant changes

## Technical Considerations
1. Must integrate with the existing project management system
2. Must update the content generation scheduler
3. Must maintain data consistency across all related tables
4. Should implement optimistic locking to prevent concurrent edits
5. Should log all project modifications for audit purposes

## Success Metrics
1. 90% of edit attempts complete successfully
2. Average time to edit a project < 30 seconds
3. Zero data corruption incidents
4. < 1% error rate in content generation after edits
5. User satisfaction score > 4.5/5 for edit functionality

## Open Questions
1. Should we allow editing of projects that have pending content generation? Yes
2. How should we handle failed content generation after frequency changes? Propose adequate solution
3. Should we implement an undo feature for project edits? Projects edits are either saved or discarded. User chooses by clicking buttons.
4. How long should we retain edit history? We don't retain edit history at this stage.
5. Should we notify users when their edited content is generated? No
