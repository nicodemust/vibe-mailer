# VibeMailer - Create Project Feature PRD

## Introduction/Overview
The Create Project feature enables users to set up automated content generation and delivery based on their specific requirements. Users can define a prompt that captures their content needs and specify how frequently they want to receive the generated content via email. This feature serves as the foundation for VibeMailer's core value proposition of automating content creation and delivery.

## Goals
1. Enable users to create new content generation projects with minimal effort
2. Provide clear guidance on prompt creation to ensure high-quality content generation
3. Implement a simple yet flexible frequency scheduling system
4. Ensure reliable project creation with proper validation and error handling
5. Set clear expectations about content delivery timing

## User Stories
1. As a professional content creator, I want to set up automated LinkedIn article generation so that I can maintain a consistent posting schedule without spending time writing each article.
2. As a marketing manager, I want to create multiple social media post projects with different prompts so that I can maintain various content streams for different platforms.
3. As a busy professional, I want to receive AI-generated content at regular intervals so that I can maintain an active online presence without dedicating time to content creation.

## Functional Requirements
1. The system must provide a single-page form for project creation with the following fields:
   - Project name (required)
   - Content prompt (required)
   - Delivery frequency (required)

2. The system must validate the project name:
   - Minimum length: 3 characters
   - Maximum length: 50 characters
   - Must be unique within the user's projects

3. The system must validate the content prompt:
   - Minimum length: 20 characters
   - Maximum length: 500 characters
   - Must not contain prohibited content or spam

4. The system must provide a frequency selector with the following options:
   - Daily (once per day)
   - Every X days (where X is between 2 and 30)
   - Weekly
   - Monthly

5. The system must display a tooltip explaining prompt best practices:
   - Include desired content length
   - Specify tone and style
   - List topics to include/exclude
   - Provide example prompts

6. The system must display a tooltip informing users that:
   - Content generation will start on the day of project creation
   - First delivery will be at 8:00 AM SGT
   - Subsequent deliveries will follow the selected frequency

7. The system must implement form validation:
   - Real-time validation for all fields
   - Clear error messages for invalid inputs
   - Disable submit button until all required fields are valid

8. The system must handle offline scenarios:
   - Detect offline status
   - Display appropriate error message
   - Prevent project creation while offline

9. The system must provide a success confirmation:
   - Display success message after project creation
   - Show project details in the confirmation
   - Provide a link to view all projects

## Non-Goals (Out of Scope)
1. Content preview functionality
2. Advanced scheduling options (specific times, multiple times per day)
3. Content template management
4. Project duplication
5. Bulk project creation
6. Project categories or tags
7. Content generation settings beyond the prompt

## Design Considerations
1. Form Layout:
   - Clean, single-page design
   - Clear section headings
   - Responsive layout for all screen sizes
   - Tooltips for guidance

2. Input Fields:
   - Project name: Text input
   - Content prompt: Text area with character counter
   - Frequency: Dropdown/radio buttons

3. Validation:
   - Real-time validation indicators
   - Clear error messages
   - Visual feedback for valid/invalid states

4. Buttons:
   - Primary: "Create Project"
   - Secondary: "Cancel" (returns to projects list)

## Technical Considerations
1. Integration with existing authentication system
2. Database schema for project storage
3. Email delivery system integration
4. Offline detection mechanism
5. Input sanitization and validation
6. Error handling and logging

## Success Metrics
1. Project Creation Success Rate:
   - Target: >95% of attempts result in successful project creation
   - Measure: Number of successful vs. failed project creations

2. User Engagement:
   - Target: >80% of created projects remain active after 30 days
   - Measure: Number of active projects vs. total created projects

3. User Satisfaction:
   - Target: <5% of users require support for project creation
   - Measure: Number of support tickets related to project creation

4. Form Completion Rate:
   - Target: >90% of started forms are completed
   - Measure: Number of completed vs. abandoned forms

## Open Questions
1. Should there be a limit on the number of projects a user can create?
2. How should we handle project creation during system maintenance windows?
3. Should we implement a trial period for new projects?
4. How should we handle failed content generation attempts?
5. Should we implement a project archiving feature?
