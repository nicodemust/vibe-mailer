# VibeMailer - Delete Project Feature PRD

## Introduction/Overview
The Delete Project feature allows users to remove specific content delivery setups from their VibeMailer account. This feature is essential for account management and helps users maintain a clean, organized list of active projects by removing unwanted or obsolete content generation configurations.

## Goals
1. Provide users with a clear and secure way to remove projects from their account
2. Ensure proper cleanup of associated data and scheduled tasks
3. Maintain a positive user experience during project deletion
4. Prevent accidental deletions through confirmation mechanisms

## User Stories
1. As a VibeMailer user, I want to delete a project so that I can stop receiving unwanted content
2. As a VibeMailer user, I want to confirm my deletion choice so that I don't accidentally remove important projects
3. As a VibeMailer user, I want to see immediate feedback after deletion so that I know my action was successful

## Functional Requirements
1. The system must display a delete option for each project in the user's dashboard
2. The system must show a confirmation dialog before proceeding with deletion
3. The system must cancel all scheduled content generation for the deleted project
4. The system must remove the project from the user's project list
5. The system must display a success message after successful deletion
6. The system must handle deletion errors gracefully and show appropriate error messages
7. The system must maintain an audit log of project deletions

## Non-Goals (Out of Scope)
1. Bulk deletion of multiple projects
2. Project archiving or temporary deactivation
3. Recovery of deleted projects
4. Transfer of project ownership
5. Modification of project settings during deletion

## Design Considerations
1. Delete button/icon should be clearly visible but not prominent
2. Confirmation dialog should clearly state the consequences of deletion
3. Success/error messages should be consistent with the application's design system
4. Delete action should be accessible from both the project list and project detail views

## Technical Considerations
1. Must integrate with the project scheduling system to cancel pending deliveries
2. Must handle database cleanup of project-related data
3. Should implement proper error handling for failed deletions
4. Should maintain referential integrity in the database
5. Should implement proper authorization checks before deletion

## Success Metrics
1. Zero accidental deletions reported by users
2. Successful cleanup of all project-related data
3. No orphaned scheduled tasks after deletion
4. User satisfaction with the deletion process
5. Minimal support tickets related to project deletion

## Open Questions
1. Should we implement a grace period for project recovery? No
2. How long should we retain project data for audit purposes? We don't reatin any data at this stage
3. Should we notify users about scheduled content that won't be delivered due to deletion? Not beyond a warning to the user at deletion confirmation dialog box that all scheduled content will be deleted and won't be delivered. Propose dialog box content. 
4. Should we implement a "soft delete" first, with permanent deletion after a certain period? No
